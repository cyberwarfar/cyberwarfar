By day, I’m just another developer pushing commits and fighting with Docker containers, but by night I transform into the mysterious “Cyber Warfare” user—slipping through code like a shadow in the terminal. My battleground isn’t made of fire and smoke, but of APIs, pipelines, and the eternal struggle of semicolons versus human patience. Somewhere between debugging sessions and TypeScript errors, I’ve learned that code is both a weapon and a song—you just have to play it right.

Once, while wrestling with a bug in my task manager app, I accidentally created a loop that played Rick Astley’s Never Gonna Give You Up every time the app booted. What started as a headache quickly turned into a legend among my friends—they still call me the “Rick Roll Dev.” Honestly? I don’t mind. If I’m going to break code, at least I’m breaking it with style.

Now, I’m chasing something bigger: building tools that don’t just manage tasks but spark creativity. My journey in tech feels like a story still being written—half serious engineer, half chaotic trickster. If you ever spot a repo that looks normal but ends up trolling you with a rickroll… well, you probably just found me.

feel free to contact me on the above given contact details. I will be glad to help you out too. 

thanks for reading !! bye bye !!
